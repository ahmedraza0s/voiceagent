# Project Summary

✅ **Production-ready AI Voice Agent Backend - COMPLETE**

## What Was Built

A comprehensive real-time AI Voice Agent backend system with:

### Core Services (7 modules)
1. **Config Service** - Environment variable management with validation
2. **Logger Service** - Winston-based production logging
3. **Deepgram STT** - WebSocket streaming Speech-to-Text
4. **Groq LLM** - Ultra-fast streaming completions
5. **Sarvam.ai TTS** - Text-to-Speech with barge-in support
6. **LiveKit Integration** - Real-time room management
7. **SIP Service** - Inbound/outbound call handling

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Async streaming architecture (no blocking)
- ✅ Barge-in interrupt handling
- ✅ Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Production-grade error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Full TypeScript type safety
- ✅ Modular, clean architecture

### Project Files Created
- 15 TypeScript source files
- package.json with all dependencies
- TypeScript configuration
- Environment setup (.env + .env.example)
- Comprehensive documentation (README, QUICKSTART, REQUIREMENTS)

## Installation Status

✅ Dependencies installed (npm install completed)
✅ TypeScript compiles successfully
✅ Environment configured with your credentials
✅ Ready to run

## Next Steps

### To Run Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

### To Test
Edit `src/index.ts` and uncomment:
```typescript
await app.makeOutboundCall('+1234567890');
```

### For Production
1. Configure SIP trunk credentials in `.env`
2. Set up LiveKit SIP following their documentation
3. Build and deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   pm2 start dist/index.js --name voice-agent
   ```

## Documentation Created
